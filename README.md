Google Hash Code 2020
---------

Google Hash Code is a programming competition by Google, which 
evolves around finding an optimized solution using a heuristic approach.
This year's problem is about optimizing the scanning process of Google Book.
The constraints are that each library has a certain number of books which are more or less
popular. Additionally, some books take longer to scan than others. The question is how to efficiently scan the 
most books in a short amount of time taking their popularity into account. 
More detailed information can be found in the hashcode_problem directory.
We used 3 different approaches which are a random algorithm and an greedy algorithm which tried to determined which 
library to scan first.
